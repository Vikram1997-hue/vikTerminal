VITALS / STATS / VITAL SIGNS
Currently - witty messages (being yelled at by Frontend / enjoying a siesta somewhere / dozing, probably. IDK. I'm just a bot dude)
                                                                                               FOR SUNDAYS / WEEKENDS
caffeine - make this go up as the day passes
energy - deplete as the day passes
stress - mad animations (timeoff during sleep? or not lol)
