# vikTerminal

A Command Prompt-like responsive interface I started building in college (late 2019) to showcase my resume... I unfortunately never got the chance to use this much, so if you're reading this and are looking for a job, STEAL THIS IDEA!


Here's a sample of what this looks like -

You can use the following commands to get a feel of the website -

## Commands

* `about` - Everything (well, not everything, but you get the picture) about me
* `projects` - List of projects
* `career` - My employment history
* `skills` - My skillset (I might add some soft skills here later)
* `awards` - Various (relevant) awards I've won over the years
* `repo` - Link to my GitHub repo
* `cv` - Downloads my CV onto client device
* `contact` - Email, socials, etc.
* `website` - How I build this site
* `all` - Basically, the output of all of the above commands (except `help`)
* `clear` - Clear the screen
